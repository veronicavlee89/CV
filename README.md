## Veronica Lee

I'm Veronica, a full stack developer in training with over 10 years experience as a Business Analyst and Product Owner on software development projects. My work experience is within the financial services industry, ranging from highly technical payments processing systems to award winning mobile banking apps. In the workplace I'm known for my analytical thinking and high attention to detail, with a love for problem solving and the satisfaction that comes with achieving the solution.

I'm currently studying at Makers Academy, a 16 week intensive bootcamp teaching full stack web development. Throughout my career I've worked closely with software engineers and am excited to be making the transition to development, and being the one that gets to bring the requirements to life.
